# Agro Kendra
Agro Kendra is an online platform for farmers where they can trade directly in the market without any of the brokers and other mediums. Thus, it will create a way of giving these farmers a wider reach to a bigger pool of consumers and will help them to increase their income and will decrease the prices of vegetables in the market. This Platform will also help farmers to get labour jobs easily in their off season.
### How will farmers use it
* They can sell all their grown products online openly to market without any intervention by middlemen, like we see nowadays.
* Most farmers in developing countries face the challenge of marketing their produce and most often meet the unpredictable market prices. Through this application they can get advantage of knowing current market price of their product and can sell at better price.
* They can get access to expert’s advice about latest research, new fertilizers, climate predictions, etc. all for their own area, so that its really useful to them. 
* They will not need to use PC, Phone, Net connection all the time. Once they put things to sell in market, buyers can call and talk to them. They don’t need to learn tech too much.
### How consumers can use
* Wholesalers can buy fresh products directly from farms without any intervention. 
* Sometimes, for any event they need things in bulk. At this time, they will have access to right market and can quickly buy products.
* Online vegetable stores also can contact farmers for buying their needs in bulk.
* They don’t need Net Connection all the time. They can save phone number of their favorite farmer and can buy from them when they need.
* Relationship between normal people and farmers will get better. This will benefit both of them.
